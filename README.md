# Physical networks
Physical networks are three-dimensional spatially embedded networks for which non-overlap principles holds. Due to this facts, their presence in physical space and avoidance of overlap 
impacts their growth and functions.

# Project overview
This is a project done for my PhD thesis research, as well as a collaboration with DYNASNET project team. A lot of this is work in progress, so the code is still messy.

Files
- There are Jupyter notebook files that used for creation of proximity graphs, caluclation of physical density and neuron data reconstruction.

Data: It will be hosted soon on another platform.
